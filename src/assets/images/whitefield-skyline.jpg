This is a placeholder file representing a high-quality background image.
In an actual project, this would be replaced with a real image file of Whitefield area.

Description of the image that would be ideal here:
- Bright aerial or panoramic view of Whitefield showing a mix of modern architecture and greenery
- Features tech parks (like ITPL), shopping centers (like Phoenix Marketcity), and residential areas
- Captured during golden hour with warm sunlight casting a vibrant glow on buildings
- Includes some recognizable landmarks of Whitefield area
- Has good lighting that shows the vibrancy of the area
- High contrast between modern glass buildings and green spaces
- Resolution would be at least 2560x1440 pixels for retina displays
- The image would be optimized for web use (compressed to under 500KB)
- Color profile should include blues and purples that complement the app's color scheme
